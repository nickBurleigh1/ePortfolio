**Reflection **

Completing the coursework offered by SNHU pushed me both academically and as a person. For all my major classes prompted collaborating in a team environment. Software collaboration class taught me a lot of valuable skills with git and bitbucket. For example, branch management and troubleshooting merge errors.  

Throughout the degree program I communicated with my professors. By choosing to attain a bachelors online, I had to juggle a fulltime job, life and school. In order to be successful, you need to work with your professors and communicate what is happening and how that effects your work.  

I furthered my knowledge of data structures, and algorithms. Whether it was learning algorithms in the algorithm focused class, or gaining practice with python data structures and libraries like JSON.   

SNHU required me to take on some larger projects, such as the mobile application course which had me create an app from the ground up. To do this you need to focus on design, implement strategyâ€™s like UML diagrams and pseudo code. Beyond design, implementing software testing for discovery and insurance, while implementing software best practice like commenting code and documentation.  

I decided to earn a degree in Computer Science with a concertation on Software Engineering the concentration course I chose was Secure Coding. In this class I learned about multiple security flaws and techniques on securing a program when developing and review/auditing programs that are in production.  

 The below projects encompass everything I have learned at SNHU. The Event Tracking app encompasses software design, testing, database implementation and security. The Daily Stock Summary, showcases data structures, algorithms and working with large datasets via mongo dB.
